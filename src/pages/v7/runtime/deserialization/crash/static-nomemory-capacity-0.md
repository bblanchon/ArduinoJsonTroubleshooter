Well, that's very bad news. It seems that your microcontroller doesn't have enough RAM to hold the JSON document.

Please read [How to reduce memory usage](/v7/how-to/reduce-memory-usage/); it shows several techniques that you can implement to use less RAM.
Hopefully, you'll make enough room for the memory pool.

If it still doesn't fit, you'll have to upgrade to a bigger microcontroller.
