Awesome! I'm glad I could help.

I would be very grateful if, in return, you could [star ArduinoJson on GitHub](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/stargazers). ❤  

If you want to support the project (and learn a lot of stuff as well), you can purchase [Mastering ArduinoJson](/book/).  
Alternatively, you can [sponsor the project on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/bblanchon).

Should you have any idea on how I could improve myself, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/issues/new).

Bye!
