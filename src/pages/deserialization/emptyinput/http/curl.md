We tried everything we could on the client side, so I'm starting to suspect an issue with the server.

Please try to perform the same HTTP request from your computer.
For example, you can use [cURL](https://curl.se/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/), [Paw](https://paw.cloud/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or [ThunderClient](https://www.thunderclient.com/).

Hopefully, this will help you solve your issue.

There is nothing more I can do for you since this issue is not related to ArduinoJson.
