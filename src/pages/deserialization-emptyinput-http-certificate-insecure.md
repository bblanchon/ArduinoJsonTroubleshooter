This confirms that the problem comes from the certificate validation.

Disabling certificate validation might represent a risk, though, because your program cannot guarantee the remote server's identity. 
Sometimes this is acceptable, but in most cases, you should select an appropriate certificate validation strategy by calling [`setKnownKey()`](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/bearssl-client-secure-class.html#setknownkey-const-bearssl-publickey-pk), [`setFingerprint()`](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/bearssl-client-secure-class.html#setfingerprint-const-uint8-t-fp-20-setfingerprint-const-char-fpstr), or [`WiFiClientSecure::setTrustAnchors()`](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/bearssl-client-secure-class.html#settrustanchors-bearssl-x509list-ta).

Anyway, I'm glad I could help.  
I would be very grateful if, in return, you could [star ArduinoJson on GitHub](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/stargazers). ‚ù§  

If you want to support the project (and learn a lot of stuff as well), you can purchase [Mastering ArduinoJson](/book/).  
Alternatively, you can [sponsor the project on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/bblanchon).

Should you have any idea on how I could improve myself, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/issues/new).

Bye!
